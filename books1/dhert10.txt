Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
the official publication date.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net
http://promo.net/pg


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Or /etext00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding.

Something is needed to create a future for Project Gutenberg for
the next 100 years.

We need your donations more than ever!

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES

[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all

you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it

such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

The Disguising at Hertford

by John Lydgate
c.1370 - 1449



a verse play written circa 1427.

This version is made available with the permission of the Master and
Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge, England, the owners of the unique
original manuscript.

For the purposes of this multi-platform electronic text, the medieval
'thorn' (a character representing 'th') has been changed to 'th'.  It was
impracticable to reproduce the original punctuation, which mainly
consisted of the virgule or slash.  Modern commas and full stops have been
sparingly imposed.  Superscript tildes and mid-script tildes have been
removed.  Mid-script dots have been changed to colons as they seem to
indicate a deliberate suspension.  The last four words of the initial
rubric (Brys : slayne at Loviers) appear to have been added to the
manuscript at a date slightly later than when it was first written.
Section marks occur in the original without consistency;  where these
clearly indicate a new section, a blank line has been inserted to produce
a similar effect.

The endnotes include the original stage directions.  Two lacunae in the
manuscript have been supplied by reference to John Stow's late 16th-
century manuscript copy of the text.  The other endnotes are glosses of
particular words in the text.

The transcription of Lydgate's text has also been published in book form
under the title 'Lydgate's Disguising at Hertford Castle', including a
modern verse translation of the text, an editor's introduction and notes,
and a study of the literary and historical background of the play and of
its first performance, which took place at Hertford Castle as part of the
royal Christmas festivities of, probably, 1427.  It is hoped that this
additional material will become available as a Project Gutenberg etext.

Nowe folowethe here the maner of a bille by wey of supplicacon putte to
the kyng holding his noble feest of Cristmasse in the Castel of Hertford
as in a disguysing : of the Rude upplandisshe people compleyning on hir
wyves with the boystous aunswere of hir wyves devysed by lydegate at the
Request of the Countre Roullour  Brys : slayne at Loviers

Most noble prynce :  With support of your grace,
Ther beon entred : in to youre royal place
And late coomen in to youre castell,
Youre poure lieges, wheche lyke no thing weel.
Nowe in the vigyle of this nuwe yeere
Certayne sweynes, ful [froward of ther chere],
Of entent comen, [fallen on ther kne],
For to compleyne vn to yuoure magestee
Vpon the mescheef of gret aduersytee,
Vpon the trouble and the cruweltee          [10]
Which that they haue endured in theyre lyves
By the felnesse of theyre fierce wyves,
Which is a tourment verray importable,
A bonde of sorowe, a knott vnremuwable.
For whoo is bounde or locked in maryage,
Yif he beo olde, he falleth in dotage,
And yong folkes, of theyre lymes sklendre,
Grene and lusty, and of brawne but tendre,
Phylosophres callen in suche aage
A Chylde to wyve, a woodnesse or a raage.          [20]

For they afferme ther is noon eorthly stryff
May beo compared to wedding of a wyff,
And who that euer stondethe in the cas
He with his Rebecke may sing ful oft ellas,
Lyke as theos hynes, here stonding oon by oon,
He may with hem vpon the daunce goon.
Leorne the traas, boothe at even and morowe
Of Karycantowe in tourment and in sorowe....
Weyle the while ellas that he was borne.
For Obbe, the Reeve, that goothe heere al to forne,          [30]
He pleynethe sore, his mariage is not meete,
For his wyff, Beautryce Bittersweete,
Cast vpon him an hougly cheer ful rowghe
Whane he komethe home, ful wery frome the ploughe,
With hungry stomake, deed and paale of cheere,
In hope to fynde redy his dynier.

Thanne sittethe Beautryce, bolling at the nale,
As she that gyvethe of him no maner tale.
For she alday with hir iowsy nolle,
Hathe for the collyk pouped in the bolle          [40]
And for heed aache : with pepir and gynger
Dronk dolled ale, to make hir throte cleer,
And komethe hir hoome, whane hit drawethe to eve.
And thanne Robyn, the cely poure Reeve,
Fynde noone amendes of harome ne damage
But leene growell, and soupethe cold potage,
And of his wyf hathe noone other cheer
But cokkrowortes vn to his souper.
This is his servyce sitting at the borde,
And cely Robyn, yif he speke a worde,          [50]
Beautryce of him doothe so lytel rekke
That with hir distaff she hittethe him in the nekke,
For a medecyne to chawf with his bloode.
With suche a metyerde she hathe shape him an hoode.

And Colyn Cobeller, folowing his felawe,
Hathe hade his part of the same lawe,
For by the fayth that the preost him gaf
His wyff hathe taught him to pleyne at the staff.
Hir quarter strooke were so large and rounde
That on his rigge the towche was alwey founde.          [60]

Cecely Sourechere, his owen precyous spouse,
Kowde him reheete whan he came to house.
Yif he ought spake whanne he felt peyne,
Ageyne oon worde alweys he hade tweyne.
Sheo qwytt him euer, ther was no thing to seeche,
Six for oon, of worde and strookes eeche.
Ther was no meen bytweene hem for to goone.
What euer he wan : clowting olde shoone
The wykday, pleynely this is no tale,
Sheo wolde on Sondayes drynk it at the nale.          [70]
His part was noon, he sayde not oonys nay.
Hit is no game, but an hernest play
For lack of wit a man his wyf to greeve.
Theos housbondemen : who so wolde hem leeve,
Koude yif they dourst telle : in Audyence,
What folowethe ther of wyves to doone offence.
Is noon so olde ne ryveld on hir face,
Wit tong or staff but that she dare manase.
Mabyle, God hir sauve and blesse,
Koude yif hir list bere here of witnesse,          [80]
Wordes, strookes vnhappe, and harde grace,
With sharp nayles kracching in the face.
I mene thus, whane the distaff is brooke
With theyre fistes wyves wol be wrooke.

Blessed thoo men that cane in suche offence
Meekly souffre, take al in pacyence
Tendure suche wyfly purgatorye.
Heven for theyre meede, to regne ther in glorye.
God graunt al housbandes that beon in this place
To wynne so heven for his hooly grace.          [90]

Nexst in ordre, this bochier stoute and bolde
That killed hathe bulles and boores olde,
This Berthilmew, for al his broode knyff,
Yit durst he neuer with his sturdy wyff
In no mater holde chaumpartye.
And if he did, sheo wolde anoon defye
His pompe, his pryde, with a sterne thought,
And sodeynly setten him at nought.
Thoughe his bely were rounded lyche an ooke
She wolde not fail to gyf the first strooke.          [100]
For proude Pernelle lyche a Chaumpyon
Wolde leve hir puddinges in a gret Cawdroun,
Suffre hem boylle and taake of hem noon heede,
But with hir skumour reeche him on the heued.
Shee wolde paye him and make no delaye,
Bid him goo pleye him a twenty deuel way.
She was no cowarde founde at suche a neode,
Hir fist ful offt made his cheekis bleed.
What querell euer that he agenst hir sette,
She cast hir not to dyen in his dette.          [110]
She made no taylle, but qwytt him by and by.
His quarter sowde, she payde him feythfully.
And his waages, wt al hir best entent,
She made ther of noon assignement.

Eeke Thome Tynker, with alle hees pannes olde
And alle the wyres of Banebury that he solde,
His styth, his hamour, his bagge portatyf,
Bare vp his arme whane he faught with his wyff:
He foonde for haste no better bokeller,
Vpon his cheeke the distaff came so neer.          [120]
Hir name was cleped Tybot Tapister.
To brawle and broyle she nad no maner fer,
To thakke his pilche stoundemel nowe and thanne
Thikker thane Thome koude clowten any panne.

Nexst Colle Tyler, ful hevy of his cheer,
Compleynethe on Phelyce his wyff the wafurer
Al his bred with sugre nys not baake,
Yit on his cheekis some tyme he hathe a caake
So hoot and nuwe, or he can taken heede,
That his heres glowe verray reede          [130]
For a medecyne whane the forst is colde,
Makyng his teethe to ratle that beon oolde.

This is the compleynt that theos dotardes oolde
Make on theyre wyves that beon so stoute and bolde,
Theos holy martirs preued ful pacyent,
Lowly beseching, in al hir best entent,
Vnto youre noble ryal magestee,
To graunte hem fraunchyse and also liberte
Sith they beothe fetird and bounden in maryage,
A saufconduct to sauf him frome damage.          [140]
Eeke vnder support of youre hyeghe renoun
Graunt hem also a proteccyoun.

Conquest of wyves is rone thoroughe this lande,
Cleyming of Right to haue the hyegher hande.
But if you list, of youre Regallye,
The olde testament for to modefye,
And that yee list asselen theyre request
That theos poure husbandes might lyf in rest,
And that theyre wyves in theyre felle might
Wol medle amonge mercy with theyre right.          [150]
For it came neuer of nature ne raysoun
A lyonesse toppresse the lyoun,
Ner a wolfesse for al hir thyraunye
Ouer the wolf to haven the maystrye.
Ther beon nowe wolfesses moo thane twoo or three
The bookys recorde, wheeche tht yonder bee.
Seothe to this mater of mercy and of grace,
And or thees dotardes parte out of this place,
Vpon theyre compleynt to shape remedye,
Or they beo likly to stande in iupardye.          [160]
It is no game with wyves for to pleye,
But for foolis, that gif no force to deye.

Takethe heed of thaunswer of the wyves.

Touching the substance of this hyeghe discorde,
We six wyves : beon ful of oon acorde,
Yif worde and chyding may vs not avaylle
We wol darrein it in chaumpcloos by bataylle,
Iupart oure right laate or ellys raathe.
And for oure partye, the worthy Wyff of Bathe
Cane shewe statutes moo than six of seven
Howe wyves make hir housbandes wynne heven,          [170]
Maugre the feonde and al his vyolence.
For theyre vertu of parfyte pacyence
Partenethe not to wyves nowe adayes,
Sauf on theyre housbandes for to make assayes.
Ther pacyence was buryed long agoo,
Gresyldes story recordethe pleinly soo.

It longethe to vs to clappen as a mylle,
No counseyle keepe, but the trouth oute telle.
We beo not borne by hevenly influence
Of oure nature to keepe vs in sylence.          [180]
For this is no doute, euery prudent wyff
Hathe redy aunswere in al suche maner stryff,
Thoughe theos dotardes, with theyre dokked berdes
Which strowtethe out as they were made of herdes,
Haue ageyn hus a gret quarell nowe sette.
I trowe the bakoun was neuer of hem fette
Awaye at Dounmowe in the Pryorye.
They weene of vs to haue ay the maystrye.
Ellas theos fooles let hem aunswere here to,
Whoo cane hem wasshe, who can hem wring alsoo,          [190]
Wryng hem, yee wryng, so als god vs speed,
Til that some tyme we make hir nases bleed,
And sowe hir cloothes whane they beothe to rent,
And clowte hir bakkes til some of vs beo shent.
Loo yit theos fooles, god gyf hem sory chaunce,
Wolde sette hir wyves vnder gouuernaunce,
Make vs to hem for to lowte lowe:
We knowe to weel the bent of Iackys bowe.
Al that we clayme, we clayme it but of right.
Yif they say nay let preve it out by ffight.          [200]
We wil vs grounde not vpon womanhede.
Fy on hem, cowardes.  When hit komethe to nede,
We clayme maystrye by prescripcyoun,
Be long tytle of successyoun
Frome wyff to wyff, which we wol not leese.
Men may weel gruchche, but they shal not cheese.

With oute counseylle of haste to procede
By sodeyne doome, for he takythe heede          [220]

Of other partye, and inquysicyoun.

And that no man withstonde it ne withdrawe,
Til man may fynde some pcesse oute by lawe
That they shoulde by nature in theyre lyves
Haue souerayntee on theyre prudent wyves,
A thing vnkouthe, which was neuer founde.
Let men be ware ther fore, or they beo bounde.
The bonde is hard, who soo that lookethe weel.
Some man were leuer fetterd beon in steel.
Raunsoun might help his peyne to aswaage,
But whoo is wedded lyuethe euer in suage.          [250]
And I knowe neuer, nowher fer ner neer,
Man that was gladde to bynde him prysonier,
Thoughe that his prysoun, his castell, or his holde
Wer depeynted with asure or with golde.
